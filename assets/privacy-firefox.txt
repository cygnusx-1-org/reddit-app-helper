**Last Updated: April 27, 2025**

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how the Reddit App Helper browser extension

you when you use our browser extension. We are committed to protecting your
privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our extension.

## Information We Collect
### Information You Provide Directly
The Reddit App Helper extension does not collect any personal information
directly from you. It does not require registration, account creation, or any
user input of personal data.

### Information Collected Automatically
When you use our extension on the specified websites (Reddit apps page and
Giphy developers dashboard), the extension:
- Accesses and reads the client IDs and API keys displayed on these pages
- This data is processed locally in your browser to generate QR codes
- This data is never transmitted to our servers or to any third parties

### Technical Data
The extension accesses the following information to function properly:
- Browser tab information (to determine when you're on the relevant pages)
- Web navigation data (to detect when you navigate to the relevant pages)
- DOM content of specified pages (to identify and process client IDs/API keys)

## How We Use Information
The Reddit App Helper extension uses the information it accesses solely to:
- Display QR codes next to client IDs and API keys on the specified websites
- Enhance your user experience when working with Reddit and Giphy developer applications

All processing occurs locally within your browser. No data is transmitted
outside your browser or stored persistently.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not:
- Collect your personal data
- Store your client IDs or API keys
- Transmit any information to our servers or third parties
- Share any information with advertisers or analytics providers
- Use your data for any purpose beyond the extension's core functionality

## Your Rights and Choices
Since we do not collect or store personal information, there is no need for specific data
subject access requests. However, you can:
- Disable or uninstall the extension at any time through your browser's extension management interface
- Control the extension's permissions through your browser settings

## Data Security
Since all processing occurs locally within your browser and no data is
collected, transmitted, or stored externally, the extension presents minimal
security risks to your data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any
changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the extension's page in the
browser's extension store. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
